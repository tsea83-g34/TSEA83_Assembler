#### Assembler for our custom cpu
To try it out run `python src/main.py res/t1.asm` from the root of the repo.
Right now the 32-bit instructions are modelled after lab2 in TSEA83 (except for `load`).

Progress:
* Right now the assembler can handle all the instructions in `res/t1.asm`


## TODO 
* Labels for data 
* Handle sizes
